# Web-Scraper

This project is to get information from the UAH cgi-bin that lists all of the classes for each semester that will be offered at UAH. We will setup the main web-scraper, then put that information into a database using a flavor of SQL, then create an API that will allow future projects to use this application.

To-do List:
* Parse information from Requests and store it into Course class
* Save Course Class into database
* Provide access to database through API
